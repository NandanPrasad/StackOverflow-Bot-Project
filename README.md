<h1 align= "center"> StackOverflow Bot Project (Ongoing) </h1>
An NLP project focused on achieving three tasks - 

  * Predict most appropriate tags for a question on StackOverflow.
  * Find duplicate questions on StackOverflow.
  * A conversational bot on Telegram hosted on AWS that can answer both chit-chat questions and programming questions.

This project was inspired by the lectures and programming assignments in the [Natural Language Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) course on Coursera by National Research University School of Economics.
