# StackOverflow Bot Project
An NLP project focused on doing three things - 
  1. Predict most appropriate tags for a question on StackOverflow.
  2. Find duplicate questions on StackOverflow.
  3. A conversational bot on Telegram hosted on AWS that can answer both chit-chat questions and programming questions.
