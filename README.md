<h1 align= "center"> StackOverflow Bot Project </h1>
An NLP project focused on doing three things - 
  1. Predict most appropriate tags for a question on StackOverflow.
  2. Find duplicate questions on StackOverflow.
  3. A conversational bot on Telegram hosted on AWS that can answer both chit-chat questions and programming questions.

This project was inspired by the lectures and programming assignments in the [Natural Language Processing course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) on Coursera by National Research University School of Economics.
